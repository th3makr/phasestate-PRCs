# Phase State Protocol - Phase Requests for Comment (PRCs)

Welcome to the official governance repository for the **Phase State Protocol**, the underlying physics engine for digital interfaces. 

This repository is where the community defines the mathematical laws of Digital General Relativity. We govern how forces are measured and how thermodynamic baselines are set. How those laws manifest visually is entirely up to the observer (you).

### The Separation of Powers
To understand how to contribute to this repository, it is critical to understand the boundary between the Protocol and the Engine:

* **The Protocol (Open & Governed Here):** The mathematical formulas, the baseline thermodynamic schemas (JSON), and the logic for tracking sensory telemetry. This is governed by the community via Phase Requests for Comment (PRCs).
* **The Engine (Proprietary):** The `th3makr` SDK is the optimised proprietary execution engine that calculates these open laws in real-time. PRCs **do not** dictate changes to the `th3makr` proprietary codebase. 
* **The Visual Layer (Relative):** The protocol dictates *when* a phase state shifts (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma). It does **not** dictate what that shift looks like. Your CSS, , product, brand, and your design tokens remain entirely yours.

### How to Contribute
We do not use standard GitHub Issues. If you want to propose a new standard, formula, or schema, please follow the PRC process:

1. **Read the Rulebook:** Start by reading [PRC-1: Purpose and Guidelines](PRC-1.md).
2. **Debate the Idea:** Head over to the **Discussions** tab to pitch your idea to the community before writing any formal documentation.
3. **Submit a Draft:** Fork this repository, use the PRC template, and submit a formal Pull Request.
